# Ghostbusters

This implements the logic for probabilistic agent tracking in a partially observable environment. It simulates how an agent (e.g., Pacman) can infer the positions of hidden agents (e.g., ghosts) using noisy sensor data and probabilistic models.

The system uses belief distributions to maintain uncertainty over ghost locations and updates them using techniques such as exact inference and particle filtering. These methods allow the agent to make informed decisions even when the state of the environment is not fully known.

The simulation helps demonstrate key concepts in probabilistic reasoning, Bayesian inference and decision-making under uncertainty.
